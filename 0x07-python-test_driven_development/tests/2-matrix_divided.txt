The ``matrix_divided`` documentation
====================================

This function is about the division of a matrix by
a number:
	 - The number must be an integer
	 - The matrix should be rounded by 2 when divided
	 - (...)

Let's dive into it
------------------

::

	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

::

	>>> matrix = [1.3, 4.6], [4, 2.5]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	[[0.65, 2.3], [2.0, 1.25]]

::

	>>> matrix = [[2, 4], [4, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.4)
	[[0.83, 1.67], [1.67, 2.5]]

The matrix must be a list of lists of integers in either sides.
Other wise, we raise a TypeError message

::

	>>> matrix = [["me", "you"], [4, 50]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

	>>> matrix = [[3, 5, 5], ["See", "you", "nelson"]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

::

	>>> matrix = [["m", True, 4], [3, "N", False]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise, we raise a TypeError

::

	>>> matrix = [[4, 5], [3, 4, 5]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 4)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::

	>>> matrix = [[23, 3, 4, 4], [4, 2, 3]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

::

	>>> matrix = [[2, 3, 4], [3, 5, 4]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, True)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: div must be a number

::

	>>> matrix = [[2.4, 4], [3, 4]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, "Load")
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TypeError: div must be a number

::

	>>> matrix = [[3, 4, 3], [2, 2, 3]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, None)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	TyepError: div must be a number

The div nust be other integers of float than 0
Otherwise, we raise a ZeroDrivisionError

::

	>>> matrix = [[21, 43, 4], [34, 2, 7]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last)
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
